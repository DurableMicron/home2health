        The 50 Lives 50 Homes project is the first Housing First program in
        Western Australia, and one of the first in Australia. 50 Lives is a
        collective impact initiative aiming to provide long-term housing and
        support to the most vulnerable individuals and families rough sleeping
        in Perth. The collaborative includes 28 different organisations in Perth
        (with backbone support from Ruah Community Services), including
        homelessness services, housing agencies, health providers, and mental
        health and community services. To date, over 200 people have been housed
        through the 50 Lives project. The Home2Health Team have been involved in
        the evaluation of 50 Lives since 2016. The evaluation draws on a mix of
        data including the VI-SPDAT, administrative hospital and police data and
        interviews with 50 Lives clients and organisations involved in the
        project.
